### What I learned
#### Using the `<picture>` Tag
This time, I specifically learned about the `<picture>` tag, which allows me to display different images without relying on CSS to specify which image appears on different devices. It's incredibly convenient!

Previously, I had to use CSS to control image display, which was quite frustrating because it required writing extra code.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key points:
- The `media` attribute is used to define the display range.
- The syntax is very similar to CSS, making it easy to understand and implement.
```html
<picture>
  <source
    srcset="./assets/images/illustration-sign-up-desktop.svg"
    media="(min-width: 1024px)"
  />
  <img
    src="./assets/images/illustration-sign-up-mobile.svg"
    alt="Illustration of sign-up process"
  />
</picture>
```
